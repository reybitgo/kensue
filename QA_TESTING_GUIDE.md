**Version:** 1.0 · **Environment:** `http://localhost/kensue/` · **Database:** `kensue_db`

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This guide walks you through every feature of the system in order. Each test has:

- **Steps** — exactly what to click/type
- **Expected Result** — what should happen if it's working
- **Pass/Fail** — a checkbox you can tick as you go

You do not need any technical background to follow this guide. Just follow the steps exactly as written.

### Test Status Legend

```
[ ] — Not tested yet
[P] — PASS
[F] — FAIL  (note what went wrong in the Notes column)
[S] — SKIP  (not applicable for this environment)
```

### Before You Start

1. Make sure Laragon is running (Apache = green, MySQL = green)
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/kensue/`
3. Open a second tab — you will need it later
4. Have a notepad ready to write down any failures
